# User-Interface-Design-for-a-VR-Solar-System-Experience-on-HoloLens
I created a VR application for the Microsoft HoloLens that presents an interactive and educational visualization of the solar system. The core focus was on designing an intuitive and immersive user interface (UI) that simplifies complex astronomical concepts through natural user interactions. The experience allows users to explore all eight planets, the sun, and key celestial bodies in a scaled-down holographic solar system projected into their physical space.

The UI was designed with a minimalistic holographic menu that floats in 3D space, accessible through simple hand gestures and gaze control. Users can tap, drag, and zoom into planets using air-tap and pinch gestures. Voice commands such as “Show Mars” or “Orbit View” enhance the hands-free control experience, catering to accessibility and ease of use. When a user selects a planet, relevant information like distance from the sun, atmospheric conditions, and surface imagery appears as floating tooltips and audio narration.

Realistic 3D models, subtle animations, and spatial audio were integrated to create a sense of depth and engagement. The application emphasizes spatial interaction—users can walk around the holographic system, observe planetary rotations and orbits, and even enter a "fly-through" mode for close-up exploration.

This interface prioritizes a learning-through-exploration approach, blending intuitive controls with immersive content. The use of mixed reality on HoloLens allows users to interact naturally within their environment, making complex space science engaging and understandable for students, educators, and enthusiasts alike.
